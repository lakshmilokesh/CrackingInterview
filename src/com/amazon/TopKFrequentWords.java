/*
 * Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
 *
 * Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the
 * word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.
 *
 * Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
 * Output: ["i", "love"]
 * Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
 * Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
 *
 * Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
 * Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
 * Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
 * with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
