 * Given a string of words and a maxWidth, write a method that inserts new lines where appropriate to perform
 * a word-wrap. (Wrap on word boundaries, assume " " is fine). Now, how does your implementation handle string with
 * multiple spaces between words ... Are those extra spaces lost or preserved?
